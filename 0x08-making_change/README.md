# Making Change

An interview coding challenge, the "Change comes from within” project, tackles a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Taking into consideration the solution’s runtime which will be evaluated in this task.
